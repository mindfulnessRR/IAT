## Scanner Task
### Task Description
1. Before the scanner task, participants were guided through the [demo](#demo). 

2. Scanner task description
    1. A scanner-adapted compassion task was designed based on theories of lovingkindness meditation that uses directed well-wishing techniques (Kang et al., 2014).  
    2. Participants were provided with an opportunity to make positive wishes for three target groups, including close others, acquaintances, and everyone in the world, and as vividly as they could, imagine situations in which these wishes come true in the future.
    3. Forty wish blocks (20 compassion wishes, 20 control wishes) were presented across two runs (20 wishes in each run) in a randomized order. Each wish block consisted of an initial wish phrase (2s; “May you be well”), followed by the target group to direct positive wishes to (10s; “Everyone in the world”) and importance rating (4s).  Control wishes focused on everyday activities to allow comparisons of neural activity during transcendent vs. non-transcendent processing, using the same everyday activities that formed the within-subjects control trials for the affirmation and control groups (e.g., “May it be done easily: Heating up food in microwave”).  Blocks were separated by fixation rest periods (3s); every fifth block contained a longer (10s) block of rest.  
    4. For the full list of stimuli, see [compassion_stimuli.csv](https://github.com/cnlab/PhysicalActivity2/blob/master/tasks/compassion%20task/compassion_stimuli.csv)

### Demo

``“The next task is called “Wishes Task.” In this task you will think about either people or everyday activities. 
In your visit last week in one of the surveys, you indicated people that are close to you, people that you know of but not too well, and everyone in the world. Correct?”``

``“Now, think of these people that are 1) close to you, 2) someone you don’t know that well, and 3) everyone in the world. For someone you don’t know that well, just think of people who you know of, but not too well. You don’t have to know their names. Make sure though these are not people that you hate.”``

(Make sure they think of these people by asking them before moving on.)

``“Can you tell me who they are?” ``

(Make sure they respond.)

``“Great, now remember these people because you will be thinking of these people in the scanner.”``

(Show them the demo slides as you explain)

``“In this task, first you will see a phrase that describes either a wish for a person or for an activity.”``

`` “When you see a wish phrase, silently repeat the phrase in your mind.”``

``“You will then see the person to whom you will direct these wishes. Your task is to think of situations in the future when this wish might be fulfilled. Try and REALLY visualize the person in this experience and think of specific details. Keep repeating the wish phrase in your mind as you do this.” ``

``“Can you tell me the situation in the future when [PERSON] may be [####]?``

(Make sure they explained the situation.)

``“Great, next you will be asked to indicate how important it is for you to have this wish fulfilled. 
To be clear, we are not asking whether these people are important to you. We are asking whether these wishes being fulfilled is important to you. Please respond by using your button box. Can you tell me how important it is on the scale of 1-4?”``

(When they indicate the importance,)

``“OK, then please go ahead and press the button ##. Does this make sense so far? Any questions?”``

(control example screen: wish phrase)

``“Sometimes you will see a wish phrase for an activity.  When you see a wish phrase, repeat the phrase in your mind and be ready to express this wish next.”``

(control example screen: target activity)

<img src="https://github.com/cnlab/PhysicalActivity2/blob/master/tasks/compassion_transcendence%20task/imgs/5.jpg" width=300>

``“Then you will see an example activity that people do in daily life. Your task is to think of a situation in the future when this wish for a daily activity is fulfilled. Try and REALLY visualize this situation and think of specific details. Keep repeating the wish phrase in your mind as you do this.”``

``“Can you tell me the situation in the future when [ACTIVITY] may [####]?”``

Make sure they explained the situation.

`` “Next, using the button box, please indicate how important this activity is to you. (1=not very important – 4=very important)”``

(When they indicate the importance,)

``“OK, then please go ahead and press the button ##. Does this make sense so far? Any questions?”``

``“Also in this task, the fixation screen may be sometimes longer. If you see a long fixation screen, simply relax and rest for about 10 seconds.”``
